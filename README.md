## Image Caption Generator

This project generates descriptive captions for images using a machine learning model. It leverages pre-trained models to automatically analyze an image and output a meaningful caption that describes the content of the image. The project is built using Python and Hugging Face's Transformers library, and specifically utilizes the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model for generating image captions.

## Features
Generates accurate and descriptive captions for any image.
Utilizes Hugging Faceâ€™s BLIP model for image captioning.
Easy-to-use interface for providing images and receiving captions.
Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
